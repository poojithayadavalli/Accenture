"""
Given a number N, print the first N Fibonacci numbers.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains the integer N.

Output:
Print the first n fibonacci numbers with a space between each number. Print the answer for each test case in a new line.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)

Constraints:
1<= T <=100
1<= N <=84

Example:
Input:
2
7
5

Output:
1 1 2 3 5 8 13
1 1 2 3 5

Explanation: Some of the numbers of the Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 ..... (N stars from 1).
